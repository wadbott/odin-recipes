    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This bacon-studded 'cheese corn' is a popular bar snack in Korea, made of pure bacon-y, creamy, cheesy, corny decadence. 
        The original recipe uses a combination of mayonnaise and sweetened condensed milk, but we're going with heavy cream here 
        for a lighter approach. This may be the first time in my career that I've 'lightened up' a recipe by adding a cup of heavy cream. 
        Garnished with green onions, this would be amazing with a cold beer!
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package bacon, chopped</li>
        <li>2 (16 ounce) packages frozen sweet corn, thawed</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, sliced</li>
        <li>2 jalapeno peppers, diced, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>2 ounces shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>4 ounces shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook bacon in a 10-inch cast iron skillet over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until almost crisp and fat is rendered, 7 to 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.</li>
        <li>Drain frozen corn thoroughly in a colander. Add 1/2 of the corn to the skillet with the bacon. Cook and stir until kernels just start to turn golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Add garlic, green onions, and jalapenos; cook until vegetables start to soften and sweeten up, 3 to 4 minutes. Tilt pan to drain off some of the fat, using a paper towel to soak it up.</li>
        <li>Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne. Pour in cream; stir and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining corn until heated through. Turn off the heat and add about 2/3 of the mozzarella and Monterey Jack cheese. Stir to combine. Top corn with remaining cheese and a sprinkle of cayenne.</li>
        <li>Broil until heated through and top is browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
